# Georeferenced Maps

Maps that have already been prepared, saved as .tif files (Projection WSM 1984) that can be directly added to a QGIS project as a raster layer.

NOTE FROM NAOMI: all .tiff files are much too large to be uploaded here. The following have not been uploaded from original files:
- `1695-3_modified.tif`
- `1695-6_modified.tif`
- `1695-4_modified.tif`
- `1705_modified.tif`
