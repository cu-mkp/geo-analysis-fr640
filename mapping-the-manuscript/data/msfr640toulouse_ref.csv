They do not make the reed longer than the sieve, & the reed is round. They attach to both edges of the reed the hair, either black or white, according to the work they want to make. And the weft is [is] done over & under as for making any other fabric. And passing a small flat stick of ii or three fingers wide between, next they pass two hairs at each step of the pedal and weave with three pedals. There are xviic* hairs in the entire sieve.
