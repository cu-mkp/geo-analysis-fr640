# Non-georeferenced Maps

Maps in .jpeg .jp2 files are found here and can be added to any project and georeferenced with a few easy steps.

NOTE FROM NAOMI: Two .jp2 are too large to be uploaded to Github and thus have not been added:
- `1697.jp2` which is 85,086 KB
- `1695-5.jp2` which is 30,418 KB
