# Maps

This is the historical maps folder where you will find historical maps that are related to BnF Ms. Fr. 640. 

There are two subdirectories:
1. `nongeoreferenced/`, where maps in .jpeg .jp2 files are found and can be added to any project and georeferenced with a few easy steps
2. `georeferenced/`, where already prepared maps have been saved as .tiff files (Projection WSM 1984) that can be directly added to a QGIS project as a raster layer.

New map images should be added to `nongeoreferenced/` and new .tiff files should be added to `georeferenced/`.

*Please only add public domain maps*

`maps-to-find.md` includes other historical maps of Toulouse, France, that have not been downloaded yet, or are difficult to access.
